###High-Level Design Goals:
I wanted to get a game that worked, but not keep everything in one class. I think that I learned most of what design I wanted to implement while going through and making this game, but I don't think I was very successful in getting high-level design goals. Definitely some of the things I want to work on for next time is making sure that my methods only do as they are labeled to do. And I want my classes to be as small as possible.

###Add New Features:
I think that if you wanted to add new features to my game it would be very difficult. To add a new level, you would probably have to copy and paste lots of code. Or you could separate out the code into the parent class level and it would be much easier. One thing that I think wouldn't be difficult to implement is adding another type of character, you could use the framework I have in Character class and implement almost any type of new Character you want. 

###Major Design Choices and Trade-offs:
I think that I don't have a justification for most of my design choices, except that I wish I hadn't? Well I guess that's a bad answer, but I think I could have done many things better now that I have taken the time to walk through the assignment and think about everything I did. I think we should do the "analysis" before we write up our assignment! It would have been so helpful. But I did try to implement inheritance and I think I was relatively successful with the Character class because I can see how that would be flexible. However, I think that I have many cons in my design choices. I think my methods are long, unwieldly and often don't do what they purport to do. I think that my classes could be further separated out, especially if I could separated out my game class into different scenarios of winning and losing, etc. 

###Assumptions or Decisions:
I don't think that I made any assumptions or decisions?
